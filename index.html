            <h2>Changelog</h2>
            <h3>v0.0.1</h3>
            <strong>Additions</strong>:<br>
            Settings... I guess?<br>Now upgrades are unlockable based on your progress.<br>
            <br>If you count rebalancing as an addition, then this should be included. You should probably hard reset.<br>
            Another upgrade.
            <h3>v0.0</h3>
            <strong>Additions</strong>:<br>
            Added <b>Upgrades</b>! Sacrifice your points in order to get more of them! Also probably changed some colors around.<br>
            Added a cool "Loading..." thing the first second you load in the game to show you that your stats are loading. I don't really think this is of any importance.
            <br><br><strong>Fixes</strong>:<br>
            Fixed the bug where instead of showing your stats, it only showed "X" (loading bug).<br>
            Made the player actually gain between "min" and "max" points depending on a Math.random function instead of you always gaining "min".
